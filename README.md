**This is a work in progress**.

Narration is the source for a modern PHP framework - It enforces the implementation of proven patterns to bring resilience, reliability, and coordination to your web application.

## Philosophies

- **DDD** oriented code architecture
- **Zero coupling** to the framework
- **Strong PHPStan** rules to ensure the quality of the code
- For **Scalable PSR-7 and PSR-15** compilant REST services.

## Quick start

> **Requires [PHP 7.1.3+](https://php.net/releases/)**

Create your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer create-project narration/narration blog --stability=dev --prefer-source
```

Then, serve the appplication at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 serve.php
```

## Structure

### Presentation

This presentation layer should contain everythin related to User Interface. TODO...

### Application

The application logic is where you implement all use cases that depend on a given front end. It delegates the execution of business rules to the domain layer. **Keep this layer thin**.

#### Application > Http > Request Handlers

HTTP request handlers are a fundamental part of any web application. Server-side code receives a request message, processes it, and produces a response message:

```php
final class Index
{
    /**
     * Handle the given request.
     *
     * @param  \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function __invoke(ServerRequestInterface $request): array
    {
        return [
            'quote' => 'Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them.',
        ];
    }
}
```

Request handlers **should** be placed at `Appplication/Http/RequestHandlers`. The routes are defined within the `config/routes/http.php` file.

This convention leads code that is easier to maintain, refactor and test.

#### Application > Http > Middleware

An HTTP middleware component participates in processing an HTTP message. It acts on the request, generating the response, or forwarding the request to a subsequent middleware and possibly acting on its response. It provides a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application:

```php
final class TrimStrings implements MiddlewareInterface
{
    /**
     * Filters the given request before or after sending it to the handler.
     *
     * @param  \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request
     * @param  \Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface $handler
     *
     * @return \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface
     */
    public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): ResponseInterface
    {
        foreach ($request->getAttributes() as $name => $value) {
            if (is_string($value)) {
                $request = $request->withAttribute($name, trim($value));
            }
        }

        return $handler->handle($request);
    }
}
```

The middleware are defined within the `config/routes/http.php` file.

#### Application > Injectors

An injector injects the dependencies of the application on the container. They **should** be placed at `Appplication/Injectors`.

Injectors are defined within the `config/container.php` file.

### Domain

Responsible for representing concepts of the business rules. This layer is the **heart of business software**.

### Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer is how the data that is initially held in domain entities (in memory) is persisted in databases or another persistent store. An example is using Doctrine code to implement the Repository pattern classes that use Entities to **persist data** in a relational database.
